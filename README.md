# My react boilerplate project
### By Teerapong Singthong

This is a starter kit for first project with React.

### Why I created my own starter kit?
I found the several good repositories for React, but they cannot fulfill for what I wants.
some repository it too old version, no one supports it and it's so complicated to start since they have many cli and helper in thier project.

### What this starter kit will provide you?
```javascript
const myReact: Array<string> = [
  'react',
  'redux'
  'webpack',
  'gulp',
  'enzyme',
  'react-story-book',
  'axios',
  'express',
  'couchDB',
  'mongoDB'
];
```
